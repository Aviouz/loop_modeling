Sample Output Files
===================
This directory contains sample data you can feed to analysis/make_report.py to 
make sure it's installed and configured properly.  The make_report.py script 
can read data either from a flat file or a database.  Typically a full 
benchmark run will output its results to a database, but the files in this 
directory are flat files because they're easier to distribute.

Each of the files in this directly represent outdated versions of different 
variations of the KIC protocols.  The details of these protocols don't matter; 
these files are just here so you can get the make_report.py script working.
